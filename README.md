# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

#
# Your Assignment

Create a branch and call it what ever name you like. Eg "react-router-example"
  ####  `git checkout -b react-router-example`

Get the repository form the github site

### `git pull --rebase <the-github-repo-url>`

Once done, you can install react-router-dom

###     `npm install react-router-dom`

Alternatively,You could just install everything listed in the package.json if you don't have it already.

###     `npm install`

When all is done run "npm run start" to see the demo locally.


# Your Task

### Create your own react router example

You have to be creative with it.

I will need 7 pages to navigate to, namely:

Home, About, Blog, Events, Interest, FAQ,  and Quotes

You can style it the way you want.

## Impliment the  bottom Bar to Have your Name, Matt. No. and Dept.
    You can style it the way you want.


## You can submit offline to me begining from the 16th to 20th Dec. 2022  
    Or you can send me the url to an online repo where it is stored.
    Or better still, you could host it on render and send me the link.

    Compliments of the season!
